The Todo app is a simple application that allows users to manage and keep track of their tasks or to-do items. It provides features like adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, editing existing tasks, and deleting tasks.

Frontend (React.js):

The frontend of the Todo app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It consists of components that handle different parts of the application:

1. TodoList: This component displays the list of todo items. It receives the list of todos as a prop and renders each todo item individually.

1. TodoItem: This component represents an individual todo item. It displays the task name, completion status, and buttons for editing or deleting the task. It also communicates with the backend API to update the task's status or delete it.

1. TodoInput: This component provides an input field for adding new todo items. It captures user input and communicates with the backend API to create a new task.

1. App: This is the main component that integrates all the other components. It manages the state of the todo list and handles API requests to fetch, create, update, or delete tasks.

Backend (Express.js):

The backend of the Todo app is built using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. It handles the API requests from the frontend and interacts with a database to perform CRUD operations on the todo items.

1. Routes: The backend defines several routes to handle different API endpoints, such as GET /todos to fetch all todo items, POST /todos to create a new todo item, PUT /todos/:id to update an existing todo item, and DELETE /todos/:id to delete a todo item.

1. Controllers: Each route is associated with a controller function that handles the corresponding API request. The controller retrieves data from the request, interacts with the database using models, and sends the response back to the frontend.

1. Models: The models represent the structure and behavior of the todo items in the database. They define the schema and provide methods for querying, creating, updating, and deleting todo items.

1. Database: The backend uses a database system (such as MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) to store the todo items. It establishes a connection with the database and performs the necessary CRUD operations based on the API requests.

Overall, the Todo app allows users to manage their tasks effectively by providing an intuitive user interface powered by React.js on the frontend and a robust backend built with Express.js to handle API requests and interact with the database.
